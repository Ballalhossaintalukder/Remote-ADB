## 📢 Important Notice

❤️ We have released a new and improved app: [**DroidKit: ADB Terminal Toolkit**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextaix.androidtoolbox)  
🚀 Enjoy better performance, modern UI, and new features.  
⚠️ **This version is no longer maintained. Please upgrade to the new version to continue receiving updates.**

## ✨Why We Created a Brand-New Version of This App
After a full year of hard work and refinement, we’re excited to introduce a completely new version of this app. Here’s why we chose to rebuild it from the ground up:
### 1. 🛠Cross-Platform Technology to Support More Features
The original version was built with older native code, which limited our ability to develop new features efficiently. The new version uses a more modern, cross-platform technology stack, making it possible to support Windows, macOS, and Linux in the future.
#### Due to restrictions imposed by Google Play policies, some features cannot be released on the current platform. To overcome these limitations, we plan to expand the app to other platforms and introduce many innovative and advanced features in the future, offering a richer user experience.

)

### 2. 🔓Free Access to All Features
We believe great tools should be accessible to more people. That’s why all features in the new version can be unlocked and enjoyed without any payment.

### 3.🧨No need to look for cracked versions or unofficial workarounds — all features are available right here, securely and hassle-free.

### 4. 🎨 A Fresh, Modern UI with Dark Mode Support
We’ve redesigned the user interface to be more modern, intuitive, and visually appealing—now with full dark-mode support for a more comfortable experience in low-light environments.

This new version is just the beginning — more powerful features are on the way. Thank you for your support, and we hope you enjoy the improved experience!
